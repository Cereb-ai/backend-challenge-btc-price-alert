# Cereb Backend Test - Bitcoin Price Monitoring

Call a third-party API to query the Bitcoin (BTC) price. When the price increase or decrease of Bitcoin exceeds a certain threshold within 5 minutes, record the timestamp, price, and price change status.

Available API:
[CoinCap API](https://docs.coincap.io/)

## Requirements
* You can use any backend development language.
* The threshold for price changes should be configurable via an import.

## Bonus Points
* Use Docker to containerize the application.
* Use a database to record data.

Note! Please do not fork this project to avoid exposing your results to other participants.
